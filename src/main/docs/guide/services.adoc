<1> Delete a domain class as you normally would. The book's `deleted` property is set to true, but book stays in the persistence storage.
<1> This `Where Query` does not retrieve books which have been logically deleted.
<3> For cases where you would like logically deleted records to be included in query results, queries may be wrapped in a call to `withDeleted`.
<4> In order to reverse the deleted field use `unDelete()`.
